# Hurricane Analysis

Codecademy project for educational purposes only.

Built and tested in a `Python 3.13.2` venv.

No external packages are required, so `requirements.txt` is empty.

## Project Goals

Write several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5
Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each
function will use a number of parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries,
string manipulation, and return statements.
